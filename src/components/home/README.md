## üé® Design Patterns

### Layout Architecture
- **Section-based Design**: Each component represents a full-width home page section
- **Responsive Grid Systems**: Flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Consistent Spacing**: Standardized padding and margin values
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Consistent heading and text styling

### Animation Strategy  
- **Framer Motion Integration**: Smooth entrance and interaction animations
- **Performance Optimization**: GPU-accelerated animations using transforms
- **User Preference Respect**: Reduced motion support for accessibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation without JavaScript

### Data Integration
- **External Data Sources**: Components consume data from `/data` folder
- **State Management**: Local state for interactions, context for global state
- **Content Management**: Easy content updates through data files
- **SEO Optimization**: Semantic HTML structure for better indexing

## üì± Responsive Behavior

### Mobile Optimization
- **Touch Interactions**: Optimized for finger navigation
- **Performance**: Reduced animations on smaller screens

3. Implement responsive design patterns
4. Add proper JSDoc documentation
5. Include accessibility considerations
6. Test across different devices and browsers

### Content Management
- Store static content in `/data` directory
